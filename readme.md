This is intended to run side-by-side with your plotting scripts. You do not need to delete a bunch of solo plots any more. This script will delete plots only if necessary
## Usage
You can tweak this script to your wish. You could for example set $delaySeconds to 60 and $minGBLeft to 10GB (or even less depending on your copying speed). That way your solo plots will be held as long as possible maximizing the chance to find a block with before they are deleted.

After tweaking you can just run it in a powershell.

## Disclaimer
I won't take any responsibility for anything bad happening by the execution of this script. I just made it to work for myself and as I like other people to benefit from my work, I enhanced it with some variables and published it here so that you can use and tweak it to your wish. Have fun :)

## Make me happy
Someone just told me that there would be people paying for this. So just in case you are one of them, I am happy for every mojo :)

So if you are willing to make me happy, feel free to send some Chia to
